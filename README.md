# decision-making-system
## Description
Web tool to assist in complicated decision making problems, utilising the AHP methodology. This application, extensively uses algorithms in order to solve a problem, by calculating weights for each criterion, factors that represent the criteria, and the alternative solutions of a target, under the influence of a factor. This online application was implemented using PHP language, an SQL database and Lapack libraries, which are used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors that help evaluating the weights for each criteria, factor and alternative.

The application enables the researcher to create a survey, to determine a group of users who participate in the research, to collect responses, and export results. Each user has the opportunity to take part in a survey and view the results of previous surveys.
The tool's implementation demonstrates the convenience that a researcher can conduct a survey through a decision-making service, using simple data forms and programming structures. Furthermore, through this service, materialized algorithms of decision-making are provided, in order to help finding the optimal solution in a more rapid and easier way.


The code was developed in 2013-2014 purely in php and html.
